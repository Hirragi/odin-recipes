            <p>Sushi is a dish known across asia for being simple and tasty. It is often eaten with soy sauce and wassabi.</p>
            <h2>Ingridients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Salmon</li>
                <li>Sushi Rice</li>
                <li>Sushi Vinegar</li>
                <li>Wassabi</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook Sushi Rice: Best salmon nigiri starts with high-quality sushi rice. Japanese short-grain sushi rice works the best. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool down slightly. When it’s still very warm, season with sushi vinegar (or white vinegar, sugar and salt).</li>
                <li>Slice the Salmon: Cut the salmon against the grain, with about 30 to 45 degree angle. You’ll need to adjust the angle from time to time to get the proper length and thickness. I recommend cutting it to 3-inch long, 1-inch wide, and 1/4-inch thick pieces.</li>
                <li>Shape the Rice: Take about 3 tablespoons of rice in your right hand. Squeeze it together until it rolls into a firm oval shape. Try to make the bottom flat with a rounded top.</li>
                <li>Add Wasabi to Salmon: Place the salmon slice on the root of your fingers. Then take a pea-sized portion of wasabi, and spread in the middle of the fish. This is an optional step, and you can skip it if you don’t have wasabi.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Nigiri: Place the rolled sushi rice onto the salmon, and bend your fingers to cover both the fish and rice together. Press down the rice using the index finger from the other hand.</li>
                <li>Arrange and Serve: Turn the fish and rice and let the salmon slice sit on top of the rice. Arrange them on a plate and serve with optional wasabi, soy sauce, along with pickled ginger.</li>
            </ol>
